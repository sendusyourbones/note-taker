# Note Taker Application

## Description

This application allows a user to store and delete notes. I built it to enable people to keep track of any information they need to refer to later, and then to delete the information once it is no longer needed. For example, a user could use it as a to-do list, deleting each task once it is completed.

## Installation

This application uses the `Express` framework for API requests, the `UUID` package to randomly generate IDs for the notes in the database, and the `dotenv` package to manage environmental variables. To install these packages, clone the repo, `cd` into it, then run the command `npm i`.
